Just got out of Squad 36 and lemme jus say, wow. I mean, my back's still aching from those theater seats, the popcorn crumbs are somehow sticking to everything — my coat is basically a crunchy biohazard now. Ugh.

The way the whole 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 spun on this axis of chaos and camaraderie, like, it reminded me of a 4th period class on a field trip to a museum — entropy masquerading as organization. Like, there was this scene where they’re just wading through who knows what, all grimy and battered. I swear I could almost hear the sound of a thousand feral ferrets clacking away on typewriters trying to make sense of it all. That symphony of chaos, man.

> Oh! you remember, you asked me to see if there was a way to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Man, I almost forgot amid all the confusion and clanking machinery.

More explosions than an over-caffeinated historian trying to explain the fall of empires in thirty seconds flat. And those dialogues, they were like playing telephone with a troupe of Shakespearean raccoons — somehow eloquent and nonsense at the same time. I mean, were we supposed to understand every line? Maybe not. Maybe that’s the point. 

The theater was like one big echoing cavern, every laugh, and gasp bouncing off the walls. I could hardly hear the dude next to me rustling through his nachos like it was the discovery of the century. Seriously, who brings nachos? Might as well bring a full damn picnic.

Someone said 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to catch the bits where you can't tell if you're losing your hearing or if they've just embraced mumbling as the new cinematic art form. At times it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a history book being edited live, pages flying everywhere, words just, sort of, you know... floating?

As we strolled out past the early credits — they go on forever these days, gotta get everyone's name in, even the guy who just picked the director's lint — I remember thinking, man, this was like jumping into a blender during the world’s oddest dinner party.

Is that even JavaScript? Who knows anymore...
